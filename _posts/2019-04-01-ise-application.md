## An overview of ISE
ISE stands for __I__nternational __S__chool of __E__ngineering, and is basically the English program of the Engineering faculty at Chulalongkorn University. As of writing, there are 5 majors to choose from. Contrary to the regular (Thai) program, students choose their preferred major during the admission process, rather than choosing after the first year of studies. The majors are (in alphabetical order):

* ADME (Automotive Design and Manufacturing Engineering)
* AERO (Aerospace Engineering)
* ICE (Information and Communication Engineering)
* NANO (Nano Engineering)
* ROBOTICS AI (Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Engineering)

## Admission criteria
As of the 2019 academic year, the [admission criteria](http://www.ise.eng.chula.ac.th/document/Admission/Admission_Criteria_2019.pdf) are as follows - passing criteria in (brackets):

1. [**5%**] GPAX - Grade Point Average
2. [**20%**] English
  * IELTS (6.0+), or
  * TOEFL (80+), or
  * CU-TEP (80+)
3. [**30%**] Maths
  * SAT: Math (620+) & Math Level 2 (600+), or
  * CU-AAT: Math (480+), or
  * A Level: Math (B), or
  * IB: Math (6)
4. [**40%**] Science
  * SAT Subject Test: Physics & Chemistry (600 each), or
  * A Level: Physics & Chemistry (B each), or
  * IB: Physics & Chemistry (6 each)
5. [**5%**] Interview

I will write about my experience with standarized tests in a separate post.

## Applying to ISE
The application process is done (mostly) online. Firstly, you will need to register on the admission website, which then lets you fill in required information for your application. You do not have to fill in everything in one sitting, as there exists a "Save" button. Subsequently, you will submit the application via a "Submit" button on the webiste (meaning you can't edit your application afterward), and you will also have to print a PDF for physical submission at the ISE office, along with a 1,000 baht fee.
