## An overview of ISE
ISE stands for **I**nternational **S**chool of **E**ngineering, and is basically the English program of the Engineering faculty at Chulalongkorn University. As of writing, there are 5 majors to choose from. Contrary to the regular (Thai) program, students choose their preferred major during the admission process, rather than choosing after the first year. In alphabetical order, the majors are:

* ADME (Automotive Design and Manufacturing Engineering)
* AERO (Aerospace Engineering)
* ICE (Information and Communication Engineering)
* NANO (Nano Engineering)
* ROBOTICS AI (Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Engineering)

## Admission criteria
As of the 2019 academic year, the [admission criteria](http://www.ise.eng.chula.ac.th/document/Admission/Admission_Criteria_2019.pdf) are as follows - passing criteria in (brackets), what I took is **bolded**:

1. [**5%**] GPAX - Grade Point Average
2. [**20%**] English
  * **IELTS** (6.0+), or
  * TOEFL (80+), or
  * CU-TEP (80+)
3. [**30%**] Maths
  * **SAT**: Math (620+) & Math Level 2 (600+), or
  * CU-AAT: Math (480+), or
  * A Level: Math (B), or
  * IB: Math (6)
4. [**40%**] Science
  * **SAT Subject Test**: Physics & Chemistry (600 each), or
  * A Level: Physics & Chemistry (B each), or
  * IB: Physics & Chemistry (6 each)
5. [**5%**] Interview

Not included above are absolute minimum scores (lower than passing scores). In only one category, you are allowed to have scores lower than passing criteria but higher than minimum requirement.

I will write about my experience with standarized tests in a separate post.

## Applying to ISE
The application process is done (mostly) online. Firstly, you will need to register on the admission website, which then lets you fill in required information for your application. Note that you do not have to fill in everything in one sitting since you can save your progress. Subsequently, when you finish, submit the application via a "Submit" button on the website (you can't edit your application afterwards), and print a PDF of your application from the website for physical submission at the ISE office, along with a 1,000 baht fee.

## Interview
From my experience, the interview list includes everyone who submitted the application and passed the admission criteria (419 students for Early Admission round). All interviews are conducted over the period of a single day (morning and afternoon), from 9am afterwards. The time of your interview is determined by your applicant number.

(**Tip:** Be the first people to create an account on the admission website for an earlier interview time!)

Each interview is approximately 10 minutes long, conducted by two members of ISE staff in the auditorium. Many interviews run simultaneously, therefore you may be interviewed by different people than say, your friend.

Most if not all electronic devices (mobile phones, laptops, etc.) are not allowed in the interview room. There is a designated place to deposit them during registration.

### Example interview questions
* Introduce yourself.
* Which major do you want to learn?
* [Looking at application] Have you studied abroad?
* Have you read the curriculum?

You should be able to answer the first question before your interview. Think of your own story that makes you unique. Why are you applying for ISE? What do you aspire to be in the future?

## Program selection
Now that you've taken your interview, the next step is to wait until the program selection list is released on the ISE website. It is this document which tells you whether you made it or not, and what your ranking is. If your name is in the document, then congratulations, you have secured a place for yourself!

After the list is released, you will have to login to the admission website again during a specified time period (next day after list release for me) to select your preferred majors from 1st choice to 5th choice. [For me: AERO > ICE > AI > NANO > ADME]

You will need to print two copies from the website and bring them on program selection day.

### On program selection day
The program selection day is another important day, as it is the day when you get to know which major you end up getting. This takes place at Chula: all eligible students register at 8:30-9:00. After 9:00, the highest ranked student gets called into the program selection room, where they are informed of the selection result. Obviously, higher ranked students are called earlier than lower ranked students. In addition, in waiting rooms there are live broadcasts of remaining seats for each major where you can see the number of available seats in each major go down to zero.

Once your name is called and you get informed of your major, you are done with the process! The next step is just paying the program fee (currently 84,000 baht/term).
